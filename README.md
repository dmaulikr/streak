# Streak
Streak is the easiest way to help motivate you to create behaviors by helping you set and track your streaks. Simply set a desired streak and the app both reminds and keeps track of how many days you've been on your streak. Stay focused on your work - not tracking it. Streaks are an amazing motivational tool - don't break your streak!

### Streaks
Each streak has a name, date started, scheduled time, status as well as a type. 

| Name        | Description | Example |
| :-------------: |  --- | --- |
| name      | Name of streak | Github checkins |
| date      | Date Started | May 5th, 2015 |
| type      | Streak Type | Daily |
| scheduled | Scheduled Time | 4pm |
| status | Status of Streak | Open |

The type defines the unit of time used to track the streak: either daily or weekly. The type also defines whether the scheduled time is a specific hour (for daily) or day of the week (for weekly).

Every time the unit of time occurs the streak needs to remind you at the scheduled time to accomplish it. So daily streaks will fire off a notification at the scheduled hour (4pm say) to determine whether the streak continues for another day.

Tracking involves counting the continuous unit type from the start of the streak until current time. A streak is broken when it is not accomplished on the scheduled time for that type.  Once broken it is archived with a completed status.
